\begin{abstract}

We examine high-resolution water isotope data sets from continous flow analysis (CFA) of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide (WDC) and South Pole (SPC) ice cores. Spectral analysis of water isotope data reveals damping of high-frequency variations associated with diffusive smoothing of the isotopic profile in the firn layer of an ice sheet. This diffusion of water isotope ratios in ice cores can provide information about past firn conditions. The data spectra of windowed sections of CFA data from WDC and SPC show different characteristics as compared with similar discretely-sampled data sets, affecting the estimation of high-frequency damping due to the firn diffusion process. The cause of this spectral difference is not known, but we suggest possible eplanations in the CFA measurement system and in natural firn proceses. Without knowing the origin of this spectral difference, we can still parametrize a method to estimate the extent of diffusion in the spectra. In this study we use a modified method to estimate extent of diffusion in order to efficiently and accurately produce diffusion estimates for full ice core CFA data sets.

\section{Introduction}

Anything more general here?

\subsection{Water Isotopes in Ice Cores}

To understand past and future climate change, water isotope data from ice cores have long been used as climate proxies, based on the temperature-dependent distillation of water isotope ratios (e.g. $\delta ^{18}O$) in the atmosphere (cite papers). This indirect method for obtaining temperature records through past glacial and interglacial cycles relies on empirical correlations that only approximate the physical processes involved. A more direct approach uses the signal of isotope diffusion preserved in the ice, overcoming the many issues related to conventional
isotope ratios \citep{Johnsen2000}.

Water isotope diffusion occurs primarily in the firn layer, snowfall in the upper tens of meters of an ice sheet that has yet to be fully compressed into ice. As firn is permeable, water can diffuse through in the vapor phase, damping the seasonal variations and high-frequency noise of the original isotope signal. As the diffusion process depends on temperature, a temperature record can be obtained by measuring the extent of diffusion that has occurred. This method is independent of conventional assumptions about isotope fractionation before deposition, and thus improves on conventional ice core temperature methods. Beyond information about past temperature, diffusion estimates also provide constraints on past firn conditions and total ice thinning. With these motivations, estimations of diffusion have been made for ice cores in both Greenland and Antarctica \citep{Johnsen2000,Simonsen2011,Gkinis2014,Jones2016}.

\subsection{Continuous Flow Analysis}

Most ice core water isotope data have been measured discretely by melting vertical sections of the core. The isotope ratio of each discrete sample is measured on mass spec or laser spec. Recently, ice core water isotope measurements are often measured on continuous flow analysis (CFA) systems. These systems continously feed the melting core directly into a laser spectrometer, yielding much higher resolution data than discrete measurements. Depending on the amount of effort committed, discrete analyses can produce results ranging from one-meter for entire ice cores to 2.5-cm resolution for smaller sections of ice cores. Meanwhile, CFA analyses can easily produce results at half-cm resolution for an entire ice core record. This higher resolution greatly improves the ability to analyze diffusion lengths, which depends on information in the high frequencies of the data spectrum.

A number of studies have estimated diffusion lengths from discretely sampled water isotopes (\citep{Johnsen2000,Simonsen2011,Gkinis2014,VanderWel2015}). While spectra from discrete data match well spectra theoretically derived synthetic data \citep{Holme2017}, spectra from CFA data have an additional characteristic in the mid-frequency range ($5^-1$ to $10^-1$ cm$^-1$). Figure \ref{spectra_disVScfa} demonstrates this difference with many discrete spectra and many CFA spectra plotted on top of one another (Christian's figures comparing spectra). The CFA data spectrum has a transition slope from the damped frequencies into the system noise. The highest resolution discretely sampled data sets do not show this transition in the spectrum, suggesting it is produced within the CFA system. Mixing and memory effects are known to take place within the CFA system and can explain this shape in the spectrum.

Since estimating diffusion length depends on the shape of the spectrum, the presence of this transition can affect diffusion results. In this paper we describe how to estimate diffusion lengths on CFA data without being affected by this transition. We start with the approaches developed in \citet{Johnsen2000} and \citet{Gkinis2014} and propose an alteration to accommodate CFA water isotope data.

\subsection{Water Isotope Data}

We use data from the WAIS Divide and South Pole ice cores, both measured at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado. INSTAAR uses a CFA system to measure the water isotope ratios of $\delta ^{18}O$, $\delta ^{17}O$, and $\delta D$ at a resolution of half-cm. For complete details on the INSTAAR CFA set up, see \citet{JonesCFA2016}.

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Diffusion Theory}

From the fundamental physics of advection and diffusion, the effects on the profile of water isotopes in the ice core can be described mathematically. The majority of water isotope diffusion occurs in the firn layer where interconnected air pathways allow water vapor to diffuse vertically through the firn column. After firn densification has sealed off the bubbles in the ice, vapor diffusion ceases and solid ice diffusion takes over, with a diffusivity orders of magnitude smaller than that of vapor diffusion.

\subsection{Firn Diffusion}

The isotopic profile changes through the firn layer of an ice sheet due to the affects of diffusion across isotopic gradients and densification of the firn. As stated by \citet{Johnsen1977} and subsequently used in several diffusion studies (\citep{Johnsen2000, Simonsen2011, Gkinis2014, VanderWel2015, Jones2016, Holme2017}), these changes to the isotopic profile can be described by Fick's second law, the basic advection-diffusion equation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \delta}{\partial t}
= D \frac{\partial ^2 \delta}{\partial z^2}
- \dot{\epsilon}
z \frac{\partial \delta}{\partial z}
\end{equation}

where \begin{math} \delta \end{math} is the isotope ratio, \begin{math} D \end{math} is the diffusivity coefficient, \begin{math} z \end{math} is the vertical coordinate assuming an origin fixed on a sinking layer of firn, and \begin{math} \dot{\epsilon} \end{math} is the vertical strain rate. The coordinate system is fixed to a sinking layer of firn, so the term \begin{math} \dot{\epsilon} z \end{math} can be thought of as the velocity in this advection-diffusion framework. Considering a layer of firn with \begin{math} z = 0 \end{math} at the vertical midpoint, \begin{math} \dot{\epsilon} z \end{math} is the speed at which a point distance \begin{math} z \end{math} from \begin{math} z=0 \end{math} approaches the origin. A solution for the isotopic profile at depth $z$ in the firn column and at time $t$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diff_sol}
\delta (z,t) = S(t) \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}}
\int^\infty_{-\infty} \delta (z,0) \exp \left(\frac{-(z-u)^2}{2 \sigma ^2} \right)du
\end{equation}

where \begin{math} S(t) \end{math} is the total thinning the layer has experienced due to ice flow from $t=0$ to $t=t'$:
\begin{equation}
S(t') = exp \left( \int^{t'}_{0} \dot{\epsilon}(t) dt \right)
\end{equation}

For analytical and statistical derivations of the solution in Equation \ref{eq:diff_sol} see Appendices A and B.

The amount of smoothing applied to the signal in Equation \ref{eq:diff_sol} can be quantified as a diffusion length, or the average vertical distance traveled by a water molecule before it reaches the close-off depth. See Appendix C for a statistical derivation of diffusion length. \citet{Johnsen1977} gives the solution to diffusion length, $\sigma$, as a differential equation:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sigma_differential}
  \frac{d\sigma^2}{dt} - 2 \dot{\epsilon}(t)\sigma^2 = 2D(t)
\end{equation}

Following \citet{Gkinis2014}, Equation \ref{eq:sigma_differential} can be solved and written as a function of density as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sigma(density)}
  \sigma^2(\rho) = \frac{1}{\rho^2} \int^{\rho}_{\rho_0} 2 \rho^2 \left(\frac{d\rho}{dt}\right)^{-1} D(\rho) d\rho
\end{equation}

\subsection{Solid Ice Diffusion}

After firn diffusion has ceased below the close-off depth, the isotopic profile in the ice core is affected, to a much smaller extent, by solid ice diffusion.

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Estimating Diffusion Length from Data (methods)}

With a mathematical understanding of water isotope diffusion, we can match diffusion lengths from ice core data to modeled diffusion lengths to learn about past firn conditions, including temperature, densification, and ice thinning. To make this comparison, we require an estimate of diffusion length from the ice core data. Equation \ref{eq:diff_sol} demonstrates that the ice core data, $\delta(z,t)$, is the convolution of the initial isotope signal $\delta(z,0)$ with a Gaussian filter of standard deviation $\sigma$, the diffusion length:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{G} = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp \left( \frac{-z^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)
\end{equation}

Rather than solve this convolution to find the diffusion length $\sigma$ in the Gaussian filter $\mathcal{G}$, we take the Fourier transform to simplify to multiplication:
\begin{equation}
  \delta(z,t) = \delta(z,0)*\mathcal{G} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \hat{\delta}(z,t) = \hat{\delta}(z,0)\hat{\mathcal{G}}
\end{equation}

where $*$ represents the convolution and \quad $\hat{}$ \quad represents the Fourier transform. Furthermore, the Fourier transform of a Gaussian remains a Gaussian:
\begin{equation}
\mathfrak{F}(\mathcal{G}) = \hat{\mathcal{G}} = \exp \left( \frac{-k^2\sigma^2}{2} \right)
\end{equation}

With the assumption that the initial isotope signal $\delta(z,0)$ can be approximated as white noise \citep{Gkinis2014}, we can simply fit a Gaussian curve in frequency space to the spectrum of some window of ice core data and solve for its standard deviation to find the diffusion length $\sigma$ for that window of data. The standard deviation $\sigma_{std}$ of the Gaussian in frequency space is related to the diffusion length $\sigma$ by:
\begin{equation}
  \sigma = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{2}\sigma_{std}}
\end{equation}

Appendix D derives this conversion factor.

Fitting the data spectrum is complicated by the water isotope measurement process. Beyond ice thinning and natural diffusion in the firn and solid ice, the spectra of ice core data are further affected by the measurement process (refer back to Figure \ref{spectra_disVScfa}). \citet{Jones2016} avoids the effect of this measurement noise by identifying the frequency at which measurement noises begins to affect the spectra and only including lower frequencies in the spectrum fit. Figure \ref{TylerWAISPole} shows examples of this fitting technique for data from the WAIS Divide ice core \citep{Jones2016} and from the South Pole ice core. The Gaussian fit ignores the data spectrum beyond a chosen cut-off frequency where measurement noise is determined to dominate the signal. This technique relies on the fact that measurement noise dominates only at the highest frequencies and does not wipe out the damping signal left by natural diffusion.

In this study we follow the fitting approach of \citet{Gkinis2014}, which uses a least-squares technique to fit the summation of multiple functions to the spectra of ice core data. The first function is a Gaussian, representing the damping of firn diffusion, and the second function is an autoregressive noise signal of order 1 (AR-1). Adding together these two functions avoids having to choose a cut-off frequency for the fit. Since it does not require any subjective choices, this multi-function technique can be fully automated and produce results in much less time and with much less effort than the cut-off technique.

The multi-function technique has been used effectively to estimate diffusion lengths on many discretely sampled data sets \citep{Gkinis2014,Holme2017}. However, when applying this technique to CFA data sets, the transition zone in the CFA spectra affects the ability to effectively fit a Gaussian to the data. Figure \ref{1_gauss} illustrates this issue with examples of CFA spectra from WAIS Divide and from South Pole. The presence of the transition zone force both the Gaussian and noise functions to attempt to accommodate that part of the spectrum. The Gaussian function is pulled to a greater standard deviation, corresponding to a smaller diffusion length, and the noise level is raised slightly at lower frequencies.

%%%%%%%% Christian worked on the lower part
In order to best fit the spectra of CFA data, we have examined two different approaches. The first approach removes the extra transition zone by masking it with white noise. The second approach parameterizes the total PSD by including an extra function in the fitting procedure. Both techniques are introduced and tested on ice core data from WDC and SPC.

\subsection{Adding white noise}
The main difference between the WDC/SPC CFA data and the discrete data is the resolution and precision.
This difference migrates into the PSD by letting the CFA data having a lower white noise baseline for the high frequencies compared to that of the discrete data (refer to a figure).
Previous studies of water isotope diffusion have not had the same precision and resolution as the measurements of WDC and SPC. Despite of lower precision, diffusion-based temperature reconstructions have still proved possible \citep{Gkinis2014,Holme2017}.
Hence, whether the transition zone is some climate or measurement induced process,
one solution is to mask the transition zone in the CFA data.
This is achieved by adding Gaussian distributed noise in the time domain which increases the white noise level in the frequency domain.
This masks the red noise transition and the power spectrum is now similar to that of older CFA measurements.
The effect of this method can be seen in Fig. \ref{WAIS_spectrum_added_noise}.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{WAIS_spectrum_added_noise.eps}
	\caption{PSD of $\delta$D for a WDC section (solid curves). Blue curve represents
			the measured signal and the black curve represents the modified signal.
			The dashed lines represent the fitted Gaussian function which
			corresponds to the firn diffusion.} \label{WAIS_spectrum_added_noise}
\end{figure}

We have constructed a sensitivity test in order to quantify the most optimal choice of noise level.
The test consist of a 500 year moving window.
For each window section, a total of 100 diffusion lengths are estimated
by adding white noise with an increasing baseline to the data.
As a result, a diffusion length estimate is available for each noise level as a function of age/depth.
By adding too much noise to the data we risk masking the climate signal.
Hence, the optimal noise level is reached when the diffusion length estimates stop changing with increasing
noise - the gradient approaches 0.
We have plotted the gradient in diffusion length with respect to added noise in Fig \ref{added_noise_sensitivity}.
For WDC, adding a mean noise level of $0.4 \, \permil$ for $\delta^{18}$O  and of $3.0 \,\permil$ for $\delta$D seem
to be the most optimal solution.

\section{Parameterizing a Multi-Function Fit or Parametrerizing the red noise transition}
The second approach concerns a parameterization of the total spectrum. In order to best fit the spectra of CFA data, we try three different parameterizations of a multi-function fit of all frequencies. In addition to the Gaussian that represents firn diffusion and the autoregressive noise function, we try adding a third function to the total fit to take up any slack in the fit and allow the main Gaussian and the noise level to relax into better fits for the low and high frequencies, respectively. First, we try adding a second autoregressive noise function, second, we try adding a second Gaussian curve, and third we try adding the PSD of a folded normal distribution (FND):
\begin{equation}
P_{FND} = P_{0_{FND}} \cdot e^{-(k \cdot \sigma_{FND})^2} \cdot |\left[1 - \Phi(-i k \sigma_{FND})\right]|^2,
\end{equation}
where $\Phi(\sigma_{FND}) = 1/2\cdot \mathrm{erfc}(-\sigma_{FND}/2) $. Here $P_0$ and $\sigma_{FND}$ are the
two parameters that are being estimated from the fitting. The justification of fitting a folded normal distribution is that it assimilates memory induced by
the CFA system.
Our goal here is not to explain physically what this part of the spectrum represents, but simply to find the optimal parameterization to fit the data spectrum. The optimal parameterization will allow the firn Gaussian to better fit the lower-frequency part of the spectrum, and thus to get a better estimate of diffusion length compared to Figure \ref{1_gauss}.

Figure \ref{GRR_fit} shows the parameterization that sums a Gaussian curve and two autoregressive noise functions to create a total fit for the data spectrum. With the inclusion of this second Gaussian in both WDC and SPC, the total fit is visually improved, as compared to the single-Gaussian fit in Figure \ref{1_gauss}. Figure \ref{2_gauss} shows the parameterization that sums two Gaussian curves and one autoregressive noise function. Similarly, there is a visual improvement in the total fit as compared to the single-Gaussian fit. Finally, Figure \ref{cum_gauss} shows the parameterization that sums one Gaussian, one autoregressive noise function, and one cumulative Gaussian function.

%------------------------------------------------
%%%%%%%% Christian worked on the lower part
\section{Results - Goodness of fits}
The different fitting procedures are evaluated by calculating the adjusted goodness of fit ($\bar{R}^2$) between the spectra and parameterizations. The $\bar{R}^2$ is a goodness of fit estimation ($R^2$) that takes into account the number of fitted parameters ($p$):
\begin{equation}
\bar{R}^2 = 1 - (1 -R^2) \frac{n - 1}{n - p - 1},
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the sample size.
The $\bar{R}^2$ values enables a comparison between the parameterizations that use six fitting parameters with
the parameterization that uses five parameters (the addition of white noise).
The $\bar{R}^2$ values are plotted as a function of age in Figure \ref{G_of_fit_1}.
It is evident that all the parameterizations provide good fits to the data,
but the best fits are obtained with the extra Gaussian or the FND.
For simplicity and computational efficiency, the Gaussian curve should be preferred over the FND.


\section{Validation of parameterization}
The first way of examining the significance of the results is by comparing the diffusion length estimates from the noise adding method with the estimates from utilizing the parameterization method. In Figure \ref{WAIS_diffusion_adding_noise}, the diffusion length estimates are plotted with respect to age. It is evident that both methods reconstruct similar diffusion lengths, but the noise adding method seems to be more stable in the glacial period. The higher stability is attributed to the fact that the measured water isotope signal seems to contain several noisy sections of half a meter or so, which will affect the spectra. By adding white noise to the data, the noisy sections are masked, making the fit more stable.

Another way of validating the results is by comparing with the diffusion lengths estimated with the cut-off technique presented in \cite{Jones2016}. While the cut-off technique requires the choice of cut-off frequency and is less efficient, it avoids the effect of the transition zone because that part of the spectrum is not included in the fit. Since these results are not affected by the transition zone in the spectrum, we can use them as a benchmark with which to validate the effectiveness of the double-Gaussian fit.
This comparison is made in Figures \ref{WAIS_diffusion_lengths} and \ref{WAIS_diffusion_lengths_thinning_corr}.
It is evident that the estimated diffusion lengths from this paper are very similar to the presented results in \cite{Jones2016}.
There are a few peaks that stand out such as an age of around 12,000 years. These peaks were not found in \cite{Jones2016} likely due
to their lower resolution (not a moving window). (Can we say anything about TAC here?)

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Discussion}

Figure \ref{sigma_comp} and Table \ref{correlationtable} demonstrate that for the CFA data sets for WAIS Divide and South Pole, the double-Gaussian parameterization of the multi-function fitting technique works better than the single-Gaussian formulation. The cut-off fitting technique provides validation of the fits, but is overall less efficient than the multi-function technique and requires a partially subjective choice of cut-off value.

While including this second Gaussian in the multi-function technique improves fit, it remains to be explained how to physically interpret the transition region of the spectra. Possible origins of this transition include noise generated in the CFA measurement system, noise generated naturally in the firn, or some combination of both. In this section we explore each of these possibilities and how to gain insight into the origin of this noise.

\subsection{Possible Noise Origin: CFA Measurement System}

There are many possible sources of noise throughout the CFA measurement system that could contribute to the data spectrum bewteen periods of 5 to 10 cm. Mixing and memory effects are known to occur throughout the system as sample water travels to the instrument through tubing and different reservoirs. \citet{JonesCFA2016} ran standards of ice through the CFA system and reported system diffusion lengths of 0.7 cm and 0.8 cm for $\delta ^{18}O$ and $\delta D$, respectively. However, system diffusion is unlikely to be the cause of the transition noise because, mathematically it is expected to increase the diffusion in the main Gaussian, rather than add this red noise in the 5 to 10 cm range.

Figure \ref{sigma2} demonstrates the variability through the core of the diffusion length associated with the second Gaussian. The CFA system remains constant through the analysis of the entire core, and thus any effects solely due to the system would be expected to remain constant as well. This reasoning suggests that, according to Figure \ref{sigma2}, there is a significant contribution from climate variation to the transition noise. However, inspection of individual spectra shows that there is an implicit dependence of the diffusion length of the second Gaussian on that of the main Gaussian. Figure \ref{sigmadependence} shows that with a greater natural diffusion length, the transition zone is shifted toward lower frequencies and thus the diffusion length of the second Gaussian is greater as well. Conversely, with a smaller natural diffusion length, the transition zone is shifted toward higher frequenices and the second Gaussian diffusion length is also smaller. Therefore the transition noise may be affected in directly by climate influence on the lower frequencies in the spectrum.



Other system effects that vary on the 5 to 10 cm range:

Water concentration and other Picarro effects? Likely not due to Emma's analysis of the Picarro noise on Boulder idle water.

Errors in depth registration? (test a random noise added to depth and see if this transition noise is produced)

Other?

To better isolate CFA system effects, we will make double measurements on ice from SPC. We will run the same meters of ice continuously on the CFA as well as sample discretely at half-cm resolution. This will give us two data sets of the same resolution to compare the effects of the CFA directly to discretely sampled data.

\subsection{Possible Noise Origin: Natural Firn Diffusion Processes}

Outline Christo's grain lifetime idea and show that it could theoretically explain this part of the spectrum.


%------------------------------------------------

\section{Conclusions}

In this study we examined the diffusion of water isotope data from the WAIS Divide and South Pole ice cores measured on the CFA system at INSTAAR. We observed that spectra from these CFA data, unlike spectra from comparable discetely sampled data, have a unique transition zone in the mid-frequencies. We found that the most effective way to estimate diffusion lengths on these CFA data sets was with a double-Gaussian parameterization of the multi-function fitting technique. This method is efficient in terms of both time and effort required, and also effectively fits the data spectrum with the transition zone.

The origin of the noise in the transition zone is unknown. It could be caused by effects in the CFA measurement system, by effects in natural diffusion in the firn, or by some combination of both. Further work is required to isolate these issues.

\section{Analytical Derivation of Diffused Isotope Profile}

Here is a complete derivation of the desired solution that I found in the slides of an MIT course ``Mathematical Methods for Engineers" from 2006, which I found at http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-086-mathematical-methods-for-engineers-ii-spring-2006/readings/am54.pdf. I've written up the steps as outlined by the MIT course, but added in many more detailed steps that are omitted on the course slides.\\

This derivation starts with the heat equation, with diffusivity D, and therefore is still not quite the solution I seek, which would also include an advection term. Equation (47) starts off with the basic heat equation.
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}
= D \frac{\partial ^2u}{\partial x^2}
\end{equation}
We can solve this PDE using the common technique of separation of variables. We assume that the solution \begin{math} u(x,t) \end{math} can be written as the product of two functions, one that depends only on \begin{math} t \end{math} and one that depends only on \begin{math} x \end{math}:
\begin{equation}
u(x,t) = G(t)E(x)
\end{equation}
We can take derivatives of $u(x,t)$ this solution and rewrite equation (47) as
\begin{eqnarray}
G'E = GE'' \\
\frac{G'(t)}{G(t)} = \frac{E''(x)}{E(x)}
\end{eqnarray}
Since these ratios are equal, they must be equal to some constant, and we can find a family of solutions that will satisfy equation (50):
\begin{eqnarray}
E(x) = De^{\imath kx} & E''(x) = -Dk^2e^{\imath kx} \\
G(t) = e^{-k^2t} & G'(t) = -k^2 e^{-k^2t} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
\textit{check solutions:}
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{G'(t)}{G(t)} = -k^2  \nonumber \\
\frac{E''(x)}{E(x)} = -k^2  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Now we can write our solution as
\begin{equation}
u(x,t) = De^{\imath kx}e^{-k^2t}
\end{equation}
Now account for all solutions from all linear combinations by integrating over all $k$:
\begin{equation}
u(x,t) = \frac{1}{2 \pi D}
\int^\infty_{-\infty} \hat{u}_0 (k) e^{\imath kx} e^{-k^2t} \mathrm{d}k
\end{equation}
Here \begin{math}  \hat{u}_0 (k) \end{math} is included to satisfy the initial conditions \begin{math} u(x,0) \end{math} at \begin{math} t=0 \end{math}.\\
\textit{check:}
\begin{equation}
u(x,0) = \frac{1}{2 \pi D} \int^\infty_{-\infty} \hat{u}_0 (k) e^{\imath kx} \mathrm{d}k \nonumber
\end{equation}
Using the definition of the inverse Fourier transform:
\begin{equation}
x(t) = \frac{1}{2 \pi D} \int^\infty_{-\infty} \hat{x} (\omega) e^{\imath \omega t} \mathrm{d}\omega \nonumber
\end{equation}
Comparing the above, we find the right hand side is exactly equal to our arbitrary initial condition:
\begin{equation}
u(x,0) = u(x,0) \nonumber
\end{equation}
So we have successfully derived the general solution as shown in equation (53).

To derive the fundamental solution for a specified initial condition, let us first consider an initial condition that is a delta function, or a point source: \begin{math} u(x,0) = \delta (x) \end{math} at \begin{math} t=0 \end{math}. This is a nice initial condition because its Fourier transform is \begin{math} \hat{u}_0 (k) = 1 \end{math}.\\
Plugging this initial condition into equation (53):
\begin{equation}
u(x,t) = \frac{1}{2 \pi D} \int^\infty_{-\infty} e^{\imath kx} e^{-k^2t} \mathrm{d}k
\end{equation}
Next take the partial derivative with respect to $x$ of both sides:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac {1}{2 \pi D}
\int^\infty_{-\infty} \imath k e^{\imath kx} e^{-k^2t} \mathrm{d}k
\end{equation}

Now rearrange to separate for integration by parts:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac {1}{2 \pi D}
\int^\infty_{-\infty} \left( \imath e^{\imath kx} \right) \left(k e^{-k^2t} \right) \mathrm{d}k
\end{equation}

where the first grouping will be \begin{math} u \end{math} and the second grouping will be \begin{math} dv \end{math}. To compute the integration by parts we have:
\begin{eqnarray}
& u = \imath e^{\imath kx} & v=-\frac{1}{2t} e^{-k^2t} \nonumber \\
& \frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}k} = - xe^{\imath kx} & \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}k} = k e^{-k^2t} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

From the equation for integration by parts,
\begin{equation}
\int^\infty_{-\infty} u \mathrm{d}v = \left(uv \right)^\infty_{-\infty}
- \int^\infty_{-\infty} v \mathrm{d}u \nonumber
\end{equation}

we get:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{2 \pi D} \left[ \left(- \imath e^{\imath kx}
\frac{1}{2t} e^{-k^2} \right)^\infty_{-\infty} - \int^\infty_{-\infty} \frac {1}{2t}
e^{-k^2t} xe^{\imath kx} \mathrm{d}k \right]
\end{equation}

The term on the left inside the square brackets goes to zero when evaluated from \begin{math} -\infty \end{math} to \begin{math} \infty \end{math}, and we are left with:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = - \frac{1}{4 \pi t D} \int^\infty_{-\infty}
e^{-k^2t}xe^{\imath kx} \mathrm{d}k
\end{equation}

Now compare equation (58) to the expression for \begin{math} u(x,t) \end{math} in equation (54) to see the simple result
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = - \frac{xu}{2t}
\end{equation}

This is now a linear ODE that is solved by:
\begin{equation}
u = c e^{-x^2/4tD}
\end{equation}

We can solve for $c$ based on conservation of the initial condition through time:
\begin{eqnarray}
\int^\infty_{-\infty} u(x,t) \mathrm{d}x & = & \int^\infty_{-\infty} u(x,0) \mathrm{d}x  \nonumber \\
& = & \int^\infty_{-\infty} \delta (x) \mathrm{d}x \nonumber \\
& = & 1 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

Apply this conservation criterion to solve for $c$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\int^\infty_{-\infty} c e^{-x^2/4tD} \mathrm{d}x = 1 \\
c = \frac{1}{\int^\infty_{-\infty} e^{-x^2/4tD} \mathrm{d}x}
\end{eqnarray}

This is the integral of a Gaussian, which is known:
\begin{equation}
\int^\infty_{-\infty} e^{-ax^2} \mathrm{d}x = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}} \nonumber
\end{equation}

Here \begin{math} a = \frac{1}{4tD} \end{math}, and thus we can solve for $c$ as
\begin{equation}
c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4tD \pi}}
\end{equation}

So now our solution to equation (60) can be written
\begin{equation}
u(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 \pi tD}} e^{-x^2/4tD}
\end{equation}

This is the fundamental solution from a single point source (recall that our initial condition used in this solution was a single delta function).

Now let us consider the possibility that our initial condition delta function is instead located a different point \begin{math} x = s \end{math}, such that
\begin{equation}
u(x,0) = \delta (x-s) \quad \mbox{at} \quad t=0 \nonumber
\end{equation}

Then the argument of the exponential in our solution shifts by $s$, i.e.
\begin{equation}
e^{-x^2/4tD} \quad \mbox{becomes} \quad e^{-(x-s)^2/4tD} \nonumber
\end{equation}

Because of linearity, any initial condition \begin{math} u(x,0) \end{math} can be written as the combination of point sources:
\begin{equation}
u(x,0) = \int_{all \; S} \delta (x-s) u(s,0) \mathrm{d}s \nonumber
\end{equation}

The solution for an initial condition extending over all points in $x$ can be written as an integral of the responses to $\delta(x-s)$:
\begin{equation}
u(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 \pi tD}} \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} u(s,0)
e^{-(x-s)^2/4tD} \mathrm{d}s
\end{equation}

And finally we have the solution we have been looking for. The one exception is that this solution does not include the $S(t)$ term that accounts for the thinning of the ice because this solution was derived from the pure diffusion equation, without accounting for any advection.




%----------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Statistical Derivation of Diffused Isotope Profile}

Lasaga derives the same solution through a statistical framework, starting with the idea of a discrete random walk. A particle starts at \begin{math} z = 0 \end{math} and at each time step can move a distance \begin{math} L \end{math} either to the right with probability \begin{math} p \end{math} or to the left with probability \begin{math} q = 1-p \end{math}. We would like to know what the probability is that after \begin{math} N \end{math} steps the particle is at some position \begin{math} z = mL \end{math}, where \begin{math} -N \leq m \leq N \end{math}.

Let us define the number of steps the particle takes to the right, \begin{math} n_R \end{math}, and the number of steps the particle takes to the left, \begin{math} n_L \end{math}. With these definitions we can write:
\begin{equation}
N = n_R + n_L \\
m = n_R - n_L
\end{equation}

and thus:
\begin{equation}
n_R = \frac{1}{2} (N+m) \\
n_L = \frac{1}{2} (N-m)
\end{equation}

We can write the probability, \begin{math} P_N(m) \end{math} of arriving at position \begin{math} z = mL \end{math} after N steps as the product of the probability of taking a particular sequence of steps to that position, \begin{math} p^{n_R} q^{n_L} \end{math}, times the number of different sequences of steps that will end at that position (because multiple sequences of steps will end at the same $z$ position, i.e. RRRL, RRLR, RLRR, and LRRR all end at \begin{math} m=2 \end{math}):
\begin{equation}
P_N(m) = p^ {n_R} q^ {n_L} \frac{N!}{n_R! n_L!}
\end{equation}

Plugging in equations (5) and (6),
\begin{equation}
P_N(m) = \frac{N!}{[\frac{1}{2}(N+m)]![\frac{1}{2}(N-m)]!} p^{n_R}q^{n_L}
\end{equation}

We can now make a couple of assumptions to simplify equation (8). First, we can assume that \begin{math} p=q= \frac{1}{2} \end{math}, that the particle is equally likely to step to the left or right. Second, we can assume that the particle has taken many steps (\begin{math} N \gg 1 \end{math}) and that the number of steps taken is much greater than the distance from the starting point (\begin{math} N \gg m \end{math}). With these assumptions, we can use Stirling's Approximation:
\begin{equation}
\ln n! = n \ln n - n + \frac{1}{2} \ln n + \frac{1}{2} \ln 2 \pi
\end{equation}

Rewrite equation (8) with this approximation and set \begin{math} p = q= \frac{1}{2} \end{math} to get:

\begin{eqnarray}
\ln P_N(m) & = & N \ln N - \frac{1}{2} (N+m) \ln [\frac{1}{2}(N+m)] \nonumber \\
& & - \frac{1}{2}(N - m) \ln[\frac{1}{2}(N-m)]+\frac{1}{2}\ln N - \frac{1}{2}\ln
[\frac{1}{2}(N+m)] \\
& & - \frac{1}{2} \ln[\frac{1}{2}(N-m)]- \frac{1}{2} \ln(2 \pi) + N \ln \frac{1}{2} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

Simplify with the following:
\begin{eqnarray}
\ln(N+m) & = & \ln \left[ N \left( 1 + \frac{m}{N} \right)\right] \\
 & = & \ln N + \ln \left(1+\frac{m}{N}\right) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

For small x,
\begin{equation}
\ln(1+x) \sim x - \frac{1}{2}x^2 \nonumber
\end{equation}

and thus,
\begin{equation}
\ln \left(1+\frac{m}{N}\right) = \frac{m}{N} - \frac{1}{2}\frac{m^2}{N^2}
\end{equation}

So, equation (11) becomes:
\begin{equation}
\ln(N+m) = \ln N + \frac{m}{N} - \frac{1}{2}\frac{m^2}{N^2}
\end{equation}

and, similarly,
\begin{equation}
\ln(N-m) = \ln N - \frac{m}{N} - \frac{1}{2}\frac{m^2}{N^2}
\end{equation}

Plugging equations (13) and (14) into equation (10) and simplifying, we get:
 \begin{equation}
 \ln P_N(m) = - \frac{1}{2} \ln N + \frac{1}{2} \ln 2 - \frac{1}{2} \ln \pi
- \frac{m^2}{2N} + \frac {m^2}{2N^2}
\end{equation}

Neglecting the term of order \begin{math} \frac{1}{N^2} \end{math} and combining the remaining terms leaves us with:

\begin{equation}
P_N(m) = \left( \frac{1}{\pi N} \right)^{1/2} e^{-m^2/2N}
\end{equation}

Equation (16) shows the Gaussian curve expected from diffusion from a point source, based only on the assumptions of a random walk and of many time steps.

This equation describes only the discrete probability of the particle taking steps of size \begin{math} L \end{math}. If we want an expression for the continuous probability \begin{math} W(z,t) \end{math} that the particle will be at any point \begin{math} z \end{math} at time \begin{math} t \end{math}, we must generalize \begin{math} m \end{math} to \begin{math} z \end{math} and \begin{math} N \end{math} to \begin{math} t \end{math}.

Define the relations:
\begin{equation}
z = mL \qquad N = vt
\end{equation}

where \begin{math} v \end{math} is the frequency of steps.

Because the particle can only reach an even numbered position at an even time step or an odd numbered position at an odd time step (i.e. N and m are both even or both odd), \begin{math} P_N(m) \end{math} is the discrete probability of the particle being anywhere between \begin{math} z = mL \end{math} and \begin{math} z = (m+2)L \end{math}. Thus the discrete probability can be related to the continuous probability as:
\begin{equation}
P_N(m) = W(z,t)2L
\end{equation}

Using this relation and plugging in known expressions:
\begin{eqnarray}
W(z,t) & = & \frac{P_N(m)}{2L} \nonumber \\
& = & \frac{1}{2L} \left(\frac{2}{\pi N}\right)^{1/2} e^{-(m^2/2N)} \nonumber \\
& = & \frac{1}{2L} \left(\frac{2}{\pi vt}\right)^{1/2} e^{-[(m^2/L^2)/2vt]} \nonumber \\
& = & \frac{1}{(2 \pi L^2 vt)^{1/2}}e^{-(z^2/2vL^2t)}
\end{eqnarray}

And with the definition \begin{math} D \equiv \frac{1}{2} v L^2 \end{math},
\begin{equation}
W(z,t) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\pi Dt}}e^{-(z^2/4Dt)}
\end{equation}

We now have an expression for the continuous probability of particles diffusing to a particular point at a particular time that originate from a point source. However, we would like to know what this solution will look like for a continuous source with spatial extent. Because the diffusion equation is linear, it obeys the law of superposition, and we can generalize our point source solution by treating a continuous source as the sum of individual source slabs of arbitrarily small width \begin{math} dz \end{math}.

If our point of interest is located at \begin{math} z' \end{math} and one of the slabs making up the continuous source is located at \begin{math} z \end{math}, we can write the contribution of this single slab to the concentration of particles at point \begin{math} z' \end{math} as
\begin{equation}
c(z',t) = \frac{c_0}{2\sqrt{\pi Dt}} \exp \left(-\frac{(z' -z)^2}{4Dt}\right) \mathrm{d}z
\end{equation}

where \begin{math} c_0 \end{math} is the initial concentration at point \begin{math} z \end{math}.

We can sum the contributions from all the slabs making up the continuous source by integrating the above equation over the \begin{math} z \end{math} values of the entire source. For a source of infinite extent we get:
\begin{equation}
c(z',t) = \int^\infty_{-\infty} \frac{c_0}{2\sqrt{\pi Dt}}
\exp \left(-\frac{(z' -z)^2}{4Dt}\right) \mathrm{d}z
\end{equation}

Defining the diffusion length \begin{math} \sigma \equiv \sqrt{2Dt} \end{math}, pulling the constants outside the integral, and replacing \begin{math} c \end{math} with \begin{math} \delta \end{math}, \begin{math} z' \end{math} with \begin{math} z \end{math}, and \begin{math} z \end{math} with \begin{math} u \end{math}, we see that we have arrived at the solution presented by Johnsen in equation (2):
\begin{equation}
\delta (z,t) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}}
\int^\infty_{-\infty} \delta (z,0) \exp \left(\frac{-(z-u)^2}{2 \sigma ^2} \right)
\mathrm{d}u
\end{equation}

The only difference between the above and equation (2) is the inclusion of the thinning function \begin{math} S(t) \end{math}, which is included as a correction for the ice thinning, which has not yet been taken into account by this statistical derivation. Otherwise, following Lasaga's statistical approach, we have now derived the same diffusion solution as presented in Johnsen.


%----------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Statistical Derivation of Diffusion Length}

The diffusion length, \begin{math} \sigma \end{math}, which is the standard deviation of the Gaussian convolved with the original signal, can also be derived in a statistical manner. Lasaga starts by introducing the probability \begin{math} W(Z,\tau) \end{math} that an atom at position \begin{math} z \end{math} at time \begin{math} t \end{math} will be at position \begin{math} z + Z \end{math} at time \begin{math} t + \tau \end{math} through the effect of diffusion. If the concentration of profile at time \begin{math} t \end{math} is known everywhere, then the concentration after diffusion acting over \begin{math} \tau \end{math} amount of time can be written as:
\begin{eqnarray}
c(z, t + \tau) = \sum_{all \quad Z} c(z - Z, t) W(Z, \tau)
\end{eqnarray}

This equation accounts for particles arriving at location \begin{math} z \end{math} from all other locations \begin{math} z - Z \end{math}. Expanding the concentration terms as a Taylor series,
\begin{eqnarray}
c(z, t + \tau) = c(z,t)+ \tau \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} + \ldots
\end{eqnarray}

and
\begin{eqnarray}
c(z-Z,t) = c(z,t) - Z \frac{\partial c}{\partial z} + \frac{Z^2}{2} \frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial z^2} + \ldots
\end{eqnarray}

Plugging these two concentration expressions into equation (68),
\begin{eqnarray}
c(z,t)+ \tau \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} + \ldots  =
c(z,t) \sum_{all \quad Z} W(Z,\tau) - \frac{\partial c}{\partial z}
\sum_{all \quad Z} ZW(Z, \tau) \\
+ \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial ^2 c}{\partial z^2}
\sum_{all \quad Z} Z^2 W(Z, \tau) + \ldots \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

The particles must exist somewhere in space at time \begin{math} \tau \end{math}, so by the definition of probability:
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{all \quad Z} W(Z,\tau) = 1
\end{eqnarray}

We can also use the definition of averages to write
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{all \quad Z} ZW (Z,\tau) = \langle Z \rangle
\end{eqnarray}

and
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{all \quad Z} Z^2 W (Z,\tau) = \langle Z^2 \rangle
\end{eqnarray}

Here \begin{math} \langle \quad \rangle \end{math} represents a statistical average. We can now write the basic diffusion equation (1) as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac {\partial c}{\partial t}
= \frac{\langle Z^2 \rangle}{2 \tau} \frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial z^2}
- \frac{\langle Z \rangle}{\tau} \frac{\partial c}{\partial z}
\end{eqnarray}

Comparing equations (1) and (73), we can write new statistical expressions for the diffusion coefficient and the velocity:
\begin{eqnarray}
v = \frac{\langle Z \rangle}{\tau} \\
D = \frac{\langle Z^2 \rangle}{2 \tau}
\end{eqnarray}

Equation (75) can be rearranged as
\begin{eqnarray}
\langle Z^2 \rangle ^\frac{1}{2}
= \sqrt{2D\tau} \\
= \sigma \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

This equation is equivalent to the diffusion length \begin{math} \sigma \end{math}, which is used to describe the ``extent" of diffusion. Equation (76) gives some insight into the statistical meaning of the diffusion length as the root mean square of the vertical position.

We can write equation (76) in its integrated form as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma^2 = \int_0^t 2 D (\tau) \mathrm{d} \tau
\end{eqnarray}

Taking the derivative \begin{math} \frac{d}{dt} \end{math} of both sides:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d\sigma^2}{dt} = 2 D(t)
\end{eqnarray}

And we can now compare to equation (6) from Gkinis et al 2014, based directly off of Johnsen 1977:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d\sigma^2}{dt} - 2 \dot{\epsilon} \sigma ^2 = 2D(t)
\end{eqnarray}

Comparing equations (78) and (79), we have derived the same expression for sigma with the
advection term neglected.

%----------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Derivation of Sigma Conversion Factor}

This section derives the conversion factor between the standard deviation of the Gaussian in frequency space and the sigma diffusion length in the depth domain.

We start with the Gaussian (Green's Function) that describes diffusion:
\begin{equation}
  G = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^{2}}} \exp\left(\frac{-x^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\right)
\end{equation}

This Gaussian is convolved with the original isotope signal in depth/time space to yield the diffused signal. Alternatively, this Gaussian can be Fourier transformed into frequency space to easily multiply the fft of the signal to, equivalently, yield the diffused signal.

The definition of transforming a Gaussian to frequency space is simple:
\begin{equation}
  g(x) = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}}\exp\left(\frac{-\pi^{2}x^{2}}{a}\right)
  \Rightarrow
  \hat{g}(f) = \exp\left(-af^{2}\right)
\end{equation}

From Eq (1) above, we can solve for $a$ by
\begin{equation}
  \sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^{2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}} \\
  a = 2\pi^{2}\sigma^{2}
\end{equation}

This expression for $a$ yields the Gaussian we began with in (1). Now we can find the Fourier transform of (1) using the definition in (2).
\begin{equation}
  \hat{G}(f) = \exp\left(-2\pi^{2}\sigma^{2}f^{2}\right)
\end{equation}

We can use this to find, for some frequency, the amplitude $A_\sigma$ of the diffused signal from the amplitude $A_0$ of the original signal as follows:
\begin{equation}
  A_\sigma = A_0 \exp \left(-2 \pi^2 \sigma^2 f^2 \right)
\end{equation}

We now have $\hat{G}(f)$ but we want $\hat{G}(k)$, a Gaussian in terms of $k$, where $k$ is the wavenumber and $k = 2 \pi f$, or $f = \frac{k}{2\pi}$. Plugging in this definition of $k$, we get:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{G}(k) = \exp\left(-2\pi^{2}\sigma^{2}\frac{k^{2}}{2^{2}\pi^{2}}\right)\\
  \hat{G}(k) = \exp\left(\frac{-k^{2}\sigma^{2}}{2}\right)
\end{equation}

And again in terms of amplitude of a specific frequency,
\begin{equation}
  A_\sigma = A_0 \exp \left(\frac{-k^2\sigma^2}{2}\right)
\end{equation}

This result agrees with Eqs (14) and (15) in Gkinis et al 2014.\\
As I've shown, the Gaussian filter yields the resulting amplitude of the diffused signal. In calculating diffusion length, we are fitting the power spectral density of the signal, and not the amplitude. Thus, we need to convert (6) and (8) to reflect the filter applied to the PSD rather than to the amplitude. Given that the power of a signal is defined as the square of the signal, we have
\begin{equation}
  P_\sigma = P_0 \exp \left(-4\pi^2\sigma^2f^2\right)
\end{equation}

and
\begin{equation}
  P_\sigma = P_0 \exp \left(-k^2 \sigma^2\right)
\end{equation}

where $P_0$ is the power spectral density of the original signal and $P_\sigma$ is the power spectral density of the diffused signal.

Up to this point, $\sigma$ has remained consistent and still refers to the standard deviation of the Gaussian in the depth before the Fourier transform, which is the diffusion length. When fitting a Gaussian to the isotope data, we do so in the frequency domain. Thus our fit gives us standard deviation of the Gaussian in frequency space, $\sigma_{std}$, which is not the same as $\sigma$ diffusion length, the standard deviation of the Gaussian in the depth domain. We need to know how to convert from $\sigma_{std}$ back to $\sigma$, which tells us the standard deviation of (1), and thus diffusion length.

To find the standard deviation in frequency space, we must convert Eq (11) to be in the standard Gaussian form $G(f) = \exp\left(\frac{-f^{2}}{2\sigma_{std}^{2}}\right)$.
\begin{eqnarray}
  \exp\left(-k^{2}\sigma^{2}\right) = \exp\left(\frac{-f^{2}}{2\sigma_{std}^{2}}\right)\\
  -k^{2}\sigma^{2} = \frac{-f^{2}}{2\sigma_{std}^{2}}\\
  -2^{2}\pi^{2}f^{2}\sigma^{2} = \frac{f^{2}}{2\sigma_{std}^{2}} \\
  \sigma^{2} = \frac{1}{2^{2}\pi^{2}2\sigma_{std}^{2}} \\
  \sigma = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{2}\sigma_{std}}
\end{eqnarray}

This is the conversion between the standard deviation $\sigma_{std}$ of the Gaussian fit in the frequency domain,  and the diffusion length $\sigma$, the standard deviation of the Gaussian in the depth domain.

%
%  SECTION HEADS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.
%
%An example:
%\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}
%
% ---------------
% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.
%An example:
%\subsection{Level 2 Head}
%
% ---------------
% Level 3 head
%
% Use the \subsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
%An example:
%\subsubsection{Level 3 Head}
%
%---------------
% Level 4 head
%
% Use the \subsubsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
% An example:
%\subsubsubsection{Level 4 Head} An example.

%  IN-TEXT LISTS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
% Do not use bulleted lists; enumerated lists are okay.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item
% \item
% \item
% \end{enumerate}
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}

% IF YOU HAVE MULTI-LINE EQUATIONS, PLEASE
% BREAK THE EQUATIONS INTO TWO OR MORE LINES
% OF SINGLE COLUMN WIDTH (20 pc, 8.3 cm)
% using double backslashes (\\).

% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with the first character following the equal sign on the first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g. \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve the correct amount of space.


%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.
